Release 0.1.12
==============

  API warning: arv_stream_pop_buffer is now blocking. Use arv_stream_try_pop_buffer
  for non blocking behaviour.

  * genicam: support for StructReg StructEntry
  * stream: new pop_buffer / try_pop_buffer functions, consistent with glib async_queue API.
  * camera: new get/set_trigger_source functions.
  * tool: support for wildcard in camera name.
  * tool: ability to perform the same command on several cameras.
  * interface: new get_device_physical_id function.
  * genicam: rewrite on top of a DOM API.

Release 0.1.11
==============

  * viewer: add a snapshot button.
  * documentation: more information on GigE Vision protocol.
  * all: memory leak fixes.

Release 0.1.10
==============

  This release should fix the lost of connection, at least better than
  the last release. It also allows to instantiate a GigE Vision device
  using its MAC address.

  * device: new "control-lost" signal.
  * GV device: allow use of MAC address for device instantiation.
  * GV device: retry gvcp command if wrong packet is received.
  * GV device: try harder to get control register value in heartbeat thread.
  * GVCP: don't use 0 for packet counter value.

Release 0.1.9
=============

  This release fixes the lost of the connection to the device after
  about 65600 seconds.

  * GV device: don't compare guint32 and guint16.

Release 0.1.8
=============

  In this release, arv-show-devices is renamed to arv-tool, and gain the capability
  to read/write and list device features.

  * Build: fix headers for C++ compatibility (Andre Gaschler)
  * Genicam: partly implement isAvailable and isImplemented.

Release 0.1.7
=============

  More work on GV stream reception thread.

  * GV Stream: handle error GVSP packets.
  * GV Stream: always set packet size.
  * GV Stream: check for control access before creating stream object.
  * GV Stream: check the number of available stream channels.
  * GVCP: more sanity checks on ack packets.
  * GV Device: reliably check for control access.
  * Fake GV Camera: make it work with viewer.
  * Debug: allow different debug levels for each debug category.


Release 0.1.6
=============

  Work on GV stream reception reliability, with improved packet resend mechanism.

  * Camera: software trigger support
  * GV Stream: rewrite of the receiving thread
  * Introspection: annotation fixes
  * Build: make stable release parallel installable

Release 0.1.5
=============

  Release mostly focused on color support improvements.

  * GstAravis: switch to negociated width, height, framerate and pixel format
  * Evaluator: fix support of variable name containing digits
  * Buffer: add a per buffer user data
  * Stream: add a timed buffer pop function
  * Stream: switch to gobject properties for packet resend and socket buffer size
  * Camera: more bounds functions

Release 0.1.4
=============

  * Viewer: support for some color pixel formats
  * Viewer: support for auto gain and auto exposure
  * Utils: Genicam xml data dump capability added to arv-show-devices
  * Camera API: Fix exposure setting for Ace Basler cameras
  * Genicam: Fix caching of registers on read

Release 0.1.3
=============

  * Simple viewer based on ArvCamera API (requires gtk and gstreamer)
  * Add a "new-buffer" signal to ArvStream
  * Fix stream IP address setting for JAI Pulnix cameras (Tom Cobb)
  * Fix use or Aravis from a C++ application (Tom Cobb)
  * Fix division of integers in ArvEvaluator when asked for float result (Tom Cobb)
  * Add an API for retrieving the genicam data (Tom Cobb)
  * Fix minimum offset of ROI (Tom Cobb)
  * Fake camera can now simulate gain and exposure setting

Release 0.1.2
=============

  * Add exposure and gain settings to the gstreamer source element
  * fix exposure setting in ArvCamera for Basler cameras
  * gather running statistics for the GV devices
  * fix GV stream fixed buffer size
  * add a new arv-show-devices utility
  * make API more consistent with the Genicam standard

Release 0.1.1
=============

  * Basic ethernet camera simulator
  * Allow detection of ethernet cameras on lo, for the GV camera simulator
  * Fix in gvcp support code
  * More unit tests
  * Add support for <Group> GENICAM element 
  * Memory leak fixes
  * Record statistics on buffer reception times
  * Improve compilation on 64 bit platforms

Release 0.1.0
=============

Initial release.
