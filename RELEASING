Here are the steps to follow to create a new aravis release:

* Ensure that there are no local, uncommitted/unpushed
  modifications. You're probably in a good state if both "git diff
  HEAD" and "git log master..origin/master" give no output.

* Fill out an entry in the NEWS file

	Sift through the logs since the last release. This is most
	easily done with a command such as:

		git log --stat X.Y.Z..

	where X.Y.Z is the previous release version.

	Summarize major changes briefly in a style similar to other
	entries in NEWS. Take special care to note any additions in
	the API. These should be easy to find by noting modifications
	to .h files in the log command above.

* Verify that the code passes "make distcheck"

	First, make sure you have 'nm' and 'readelf' commands in PATH.
	this should be OK with any Linux distro.

	Running "make distcheck" should result in no warnings or
	errors and end with a message of the form:

	=============================================
	aravis-X.Y.Z archives ready for distribution:
	aravis-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
	=============================================

	(But the tar file isn't actually ready yet, as we still have
	some more steps to follow).

* Tag the release; This will allow you to make a branch later if you so desire
but for now, at least it make it easy to see what was included in a particular
release. The commit message for the tag will be included in a changes file in
the release directory.

	$ git tag -a ARAVIS_X_Y_Z (from whatever branch you're releasing)
	$ git push origin ARAVIS_X_Y_Z

If that fails because someone has pushed since you last updated, then you'll
need to repeat the entire process. Well, update, add a new NEWS entry, and
make distcheck again.

* Upload the tarball to ftp.gnome.org, by scp-ing it to master.gnome.org. All
  module maintainers who wish to be able to upload tarballs should request a
  shell account at master.gnome.org for this purpose -- see AccountPolicy.
  Ask someone else to do it for you if you are waiting for an account.

  For example:

  	$ scp aravis-0.1.3.tar.gz (user)@master.gnome.org:

  Then ssh into master.gnome.org and call ftp-admin. There are no extra
  steps required for new modules.

  For example:

  	$ ftpadmin install aravis-0.1.3.tar.gz

  This will move the tarball to the appropriate directory, do some additional
  administrative stuff, and send an email to the ftp-release mailing list so
  that the release-team will know about it.

* Increment the version number in configure.ac, and push the change.

* Send a message to aravis@freelists.org to announce the new
  release adding the excerpt from NEWS, your signature, followed
  by the standard "What is aravis" and "Where to get more information
  about aravis" blurbs from README, and finally the shortlog of all
  changes since last release, generated by:

	git shortlog ARAVIS_X_Y_Z...

  where ARAVIS_X_Y_Z is the last released version.

* Edit the aravis wiki to add the announcement to the NEWS page and
  the front page. (just the parts before your signature).

(This release procedure is an adaptation of the RELEASING file found in cairo,
 and of what can be found here: http://live.gnome.org/MaintainersCorner/Releasing).
