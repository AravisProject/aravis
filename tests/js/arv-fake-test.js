   If you have installed aravis in a non standard location, you may need
   to make GI_TYPELIB_PATH point to the correct location. For example:

   export GI_TYPELIB_PATH=$GI_TYPELIB_PATH:/opt/bin/lib/girepositry-1.0/

   You may also have to give the path to libaravis.so, using LD_PRELOAD or
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
