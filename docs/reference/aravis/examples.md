Title: Examples

# Examples

While most of the API is documented, Aravis documentation lacks some good
tutorial about the many features if offers. But a good resource is the `tests`
directory inside Aravis sources, where you will find a set of small samples
showing different key features.

Additionally, there is [an example repository with C samples](https://github.com/AravisProject/aravis-c-examples).
