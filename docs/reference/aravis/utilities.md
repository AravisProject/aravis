# Utilities

The main goal of Aravis is to provide a library that interfaces with industrial
cameras. It also provides a set of utilities that help to debug the library,
namely `arv-viewer-0.8`, `arv-tool-0.8`, `arv-camera-test-0.8` and
`arv-fake-gv-camera-0.8`. The version suffix corresponds to the API version, as
several stable series of Aravis can be installed at the same time.

The options for each utility is obtained using `--help` argument.
